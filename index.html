        <h2>Hello and welcome to my bio!</h2>
        <h3>About Me.</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Marissa Wayte and I am currently a student of Graphic
          Design at Algonquin College.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design
          principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools,
          including Adobe Creative Suite(Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign)
          Figma, and Sketch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have
          also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design,
          such as motion graphics and web design.

          <h4>Logo Creation</h4>
          <p>
            Your logo is the face of your brand and the first thing that
            potential customers will see, so it's crucial to make a great first
            impression. I can help create a logo that is both visually stunning
            and effective in representing your brand.

          <h4>Web Design</h4>
          <p>
            Your website is often the first interaction customers have with your
            business, so it's important to make a strong first impression. I can
            help you create a website that not only looks great but also
            functions flawlessly and engages your target audience.

          <h4>Full Branding</h4>
          <p>
            Your brand is much more than just a logo or a website. It's the
            overall image that your business presents to the world, including
            the look, feel, and voice of your brand. I can help you create a
            cohesive and impactful brand that resonates with your target
            audience and sets you apart from your competitors.
